In
the 
creative 
coding 
book 
Aesthetic 
Programming
authors 
Winnie Soon 
and 
Geoff Cox
present 
an exercise 
that 
asks 
students 
to 
animate 
a "thob," 
that 
virtual 
indicator 
of 
operations 
in 
process. 

It 
is 
a measure 
of 
time, 
but 
without 
a sense 
of 
progress; 
just 
a cycle 
that 
may 
end 
at any 
moment 
(if at all). 


It 
got 
me 
thinking 
about 
time 
as 
experienced 
during 
the 
pandemic. 


Time 
has 
taken 
on 
a different 
feel.
